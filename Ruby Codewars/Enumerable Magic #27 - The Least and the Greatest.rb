# Enumerable Magic #27 - The Least and the Greatest - Create a method minmax that accepts a list and a block. The block itself should compare two elements, so the method can sort the elements and return the minimum and maximum as a 2-element array.

# problem
def minmax list, &block
  end

# solution
def minmax list, &block
    list.minmax(&block)
  end
